<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>Very good lasagna! My husband & I enjoyed it very much. I made a few changes, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and also used Barilla lasagna oven ready-no boil noodles.I then added sliced mushrooms and shredded parmesan cheese. This recipe was very fast & easy to make! I'd recommend this to anyone. This one is definetly a keeper!
