<h1>Gourmet White Pizza</h1>

<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>This is not at all like the white pizza I am familiar with, but I'm glad we tried it. We really liked this pizza - the sauce and chicken go really well together. I think we will use that sauce on other things too. We put some mozzerella cheese on top and it came out well. Next time, I'll make a couple of changes. First, it was a little too saucy. We ate it with fork and knife, although the sauce was very good. Maybe I should have gotten a large pizza crust instead of the medium. Also, we will bake this directly on the rack instead of using a pizza stone so the middle gets crispier. Note - We used Biboli pizza crust.
